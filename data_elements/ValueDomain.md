#Value Domain Profile
Description: Value Domain is a class each instance of which models a value domain, a collection of permissible values. A value domain provides representation, but has no implication as to what data element concept the values are associated with, nor what the values mean. Permissible values are designations, bindings of signs (values) to their corresponding value meanings<table><thead><tr><th scope='col'>Property</th><th scope='col'>Definition</th></tr><tr><td><a href='DataTypeCode.md'>Data Type Code</a></td><td>Character</td></tr><tr><td><a href='MinimumLengthNumber.md'>Minimum Length Number</a></td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><a href='MaximumLengthNumber.md'>Maximum Length Number</a></td><td>255</td></tr><tr><td><a href='RepresentationClass.md'>Representation Class Code</a></td><td>Name</td></tr></table>An example of a conceptual domain and a set of value domains is ISO 3166, Codes for the representation of names of countries. For instance, ISO 3166 describes the set of seven value domains: short name in English, official name in English, short name in French, official name in French, alpha-2 code, alpha-3 code, and numeric code.  Additional examples of value domains are: Sex, which contains two designations (permissible values), M -> Male and F-> Female; Parent, which contains two designations (permissible values), M -> Mother and F -> Father.
