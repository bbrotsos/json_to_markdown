<thead><tr><th scope='col'>Value Item</th><th scope='col'>Value Meaning</th></tr></thead><tr><td>Integer</td><td>The value space of integer is the infinite set {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}.  Essentially, the integer data type is used to specify a numeric value without a fractional component.</td></tr><tr><td>Character</td><td>Characters are classified for convenience as letters, digits, or other characters. A character is an atomic unit of text as specified by ISO/IEC 10646.</td></tr><tr><td>Boolean</td><td>Boolean has the value space required to support the mathematical concept of binary-valued logic: {true, false}.</td></tr><tr><td>Enumerated</td><td>The value space of a list datatype is a set of finite-length sequences of atomic values. The enumeration is a set of values from the value space.</td></tr><tr><td>Date-and-Time</td><td>The value space of Date-Time is closely related to the dates and times described in ISO 8601.
