## Known Problems
1. This research supports the problem of searching through many, many data assets and data sets.  When searching
through 100s of data assets and 1000s of data element, an architect or researcher does not have time to ask each business owner
the requirements and documentation on data.  The average
developer does not face this problem, so it is difficult showing the business benefit to application developers.

2. There's a steep learning curve for average developer to get up to speed with minimal immediate benefit.

Data Element: Unit of data that is considered in context to be indivisible.

A Data Element is considered to be a basic unit of data of interest to an organization. It is a unit of data for which the definition, identification, representation, and permissible values 
are specified by means of a set of attributes. A Data Element is formed when a Data Element Concept is assigned a representation. One of the key components of a representation is the Value Domain, i.e., restricted valid values.

Validation, conversion, display, and search of tabular data on the web requires additional metadata that describes how the data should be interpreted. This document defines a vocabulary for metadata that annotates tabular data. This can be used to provide metadata at various levels, from groups of tables and how they relate to each other down to individual cells within a table.

Swagger™ is a project used to describe and document RESTful APIs. The Swagger specification defines a set of files required to describe such an API. These files can then be used by the Swagger-UI project to display the API and Swagger-Codegen to generate clients in various languages. Additional utilities can also take advantage of the resulting files, such as testing tools.

Introduces and discusses fundamental ideas of data elements, value domains, data element concepts, conceptual domains, and classification schemes essential to the understanding of this set of standards and provides the context for associating the individual parts of ISO/IEC 11179.
