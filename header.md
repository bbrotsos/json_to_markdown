## Known Problems
1. This research supports the problem of searching through many, many data assets and data sets.  When searching
through 100s of data assets and 1000s of data element, an architect or researcher does not have time to ask each business owner
the requirements and documentation on data.  The average
developer does not face this problem, so it is difficult showing the business benefit to application developers.

2. Current documentation is rooted in library science and computer science and can be inaccessible to the
average developer.  There's a steep learning curve to get up to speed with minimal immediate benefit.
