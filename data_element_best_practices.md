#Data Element Naming Best Practices

_mostly copied from iso 11179_

* Follow order Qualifier + Object Class + Qualifier + Property + Representation Term
* Independent of Technology – Use Business Terms with spaces
* Nouns are used in singular form only. Verbs (if any) are in the present tense.
* All names in each language shall be unique within this context.

Not in ISO:

* Don’t use Organization Names
* Don’t use Acronyms 
* Don’t use System Names
* Don’t use prepositions or conjunctions (You can break this sometimes eg Unit of Measure)
