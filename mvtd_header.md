# Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data

"Validation, conversion, display, and search of tabular data on the web requires additional metadata that describes how the data should be interpreted. This document defines a vocabulary for metadata that annotates tabular data. This can be used to provide metadata at various levels, from groups of tables and how they relate to each other down to individual cells within a table.

The metadata defined in this specification is used to provide annotations on an annotated table or group of tables, as defined in [tabular-data-model]. Annotated tables form the basis for all further processing, such as validating, converting, or displaying the tables."
